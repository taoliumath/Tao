We study eigenvalues of the Dirac operator with canonical form 

where p and q are real functions. Under the assumption that limsup x&#8730<p^2(x)+q^2(x))><&infin, the essential spectrum of Lpq is (-&infin, &infin). 
We prove that Lpq has no eigenvalues if limsup x\sqrt(p^2(x)+q^2(x))<1/2. 
Given any A&gt 1/2 and any λ, we construct functions p and q such that limsup x\sqrt(p^2(x)+q^2(x))=A and λ is an eigenvalue of the corresponding Dirac operator. 
We also construct functions p and q so that the corresponding Dirac operator Lpq has any prescribed set (finitely or countably many) of eigenvalues.
